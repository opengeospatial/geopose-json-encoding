= Draft OGC GeoPose 1.1 JSON Encoding

Welcome to the OGC GeoPose 1.1 JSON Encoding specification GitHub Repo.

This repository is the responsibility of the  https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/geoposeswg[GeoPose Standards Working Group (SWG)], working under the auspices of the https://www.ogc.org/[Open Geospatial Consortium]. The purpose of this repository is to define the JSON encoding for all standardization targets defined in the original https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html[OGC GeoPose 1.0 Data Exchange Standard] for geographically-anchored pose (GeoPose) with 6 degrees of freedom referenced to one or more standardized Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs), as well as GeoPose components to be exposed in the GeoPose 1.1 Conceptual Model standard.

This draft specification describes the JSON encoding for GeoPoses of objects to permit their seamless expression, recording, and sharing in an entirely consistent manner across different applications, users, devices, services, and platforms that adopt the standard or are able to translate/exchange the GeoPose into another CRS. 

This repository holds the latest Editor's Draft of the GeoPose 1.1 JSON Encoding specification and reflects the current agreement of members of the https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/geoposeswg[GeoPose SWG]

# Draft OGC GeoPose 1.1 Conceptual Model

In June 2022, the OGC Technical Committee approved the https://docs.ogc.org/is/21-056r11/21-056r11.html[OGC GeoPose 1.0 Data Exchange Standard] as an OGC Specification that included both the Conceptual Model and a JSON encoding. The Conceptual Model of the GeoPose 1.0 Standard is being updated in a https://github.com/opengeospatial/geopose-cm[separate GitHub repository] and will be published as a new OGC specification.

As indicated by keeping the first number of the standard constant (v 1.0 and v 1.1), the standard defined in this repository will be fully backward compatible so any investment based on v 1.0 will not be lost. One benefit of v1.1 will be that other standards can reference one or more GeoPose components normatively.

# Contributing
The OGC GeoPose SWG is the group at OGC responsible for the stewardship of the standard. The separation of the Conceptual Model, the exposure of GeoPose components and publication of the JSON encoding as a separate specification is the scope of Work Packages 1 and 2 as defined in https://geopose.org/CallForContributors.html[this document and invitation for contributors].

If you have input, comments or feedback for the SWG's consideration, please begin by reviewing the https://github.com/opengeospatial/geopose-json-encoding/issues[open issues]. If there is already an issue with your question, concern or input, please respond or discuss it in the issue. If your input, feedback or question is new (not captured in a prior issue), please open a new issue.

The GeoPose SWG will promptly review open issues and address or reply to new issues in a timely manner.
